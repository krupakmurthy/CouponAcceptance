# CouponAcceptance
This is a part of Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?. The goal of this assignment is to find if the driver accepts a coupon while driving during work. This will enhance visualization and probability distributions skills.

The skills I learned when doing this assignment:
1. data cleaning
2. plotting/visualization
3. probability distribution
4. data analysis

My findings were based on two types of coupons - Bar and CoffeeHouse. 

### Bar Coupon
Bar Coupon acceptance rate is 41%, meaning 41% of the drivers accepted a Bar coupon while driving on work. There were various data points to look at. For example - age, passenger, frequency of visits to bar etc. Drivers who visit bar more often (greater than 3 times in a month) tend to accept  bar coupon on a higher rate - approximately 76.88% as opposed to the smaller proportion of drivers who do not visit bar as frequently (37.06%). Age along with frequency to bar plays a major role in determining if the driver will accept a bar coupon. As age and frequency of vists to bar increase, the higher is the acceptance rate (69.52%). The rate is also high when the passenger with the driver is not a kid and the driver does not work in farming, fishing, or forestry industry. The rate is about 71.32%. If the visits to bar are frequent and also if the driver salary is less than 50k, then there is higher change of accepting a bar coupon.

### Coffee House Coupon
Coffee House Coupon analysis was interesting. the acceptance rate for coffee house coupon is almost as equal as its rejection rate - 49.9% and 51.1% respectively. From the analysis, looks like coffee is an amazing companion when traveling alone but seems like it is also the most rejected when travelling alone and most used when travelling wuth a friend. Strangely, the coffee house coupon acceptance rate when the weather is rainly or snowy and the driver is traveling alone is just 45.7%. We can see from the plot that gender almost makes no difference in terms of acceptance of a coffee house coupon. As seen from the plot, age groups less than 26 tend to use more coupon house coupons as opposed to their elderly counterpart. the most surprising part, as seen from the pie chart is drivers accept coffee coupons the most when it is sunny.
